# Project-Gamer-VSCoin
VSCoin is a Cryptocurrency that was developed that will be Ethereum fueled and will be used to power an unique software ecosystem 


Hello I want to thank you for taking this journey with me.  

if you are reading this that means you are interested in VSCoin. 

VSCoin is an Altcoin powered by Ethereum and soon will be available on many Crypto exchanges. 

  

I have big plans for VSCoin. so, I will tell you the point of VSCoin.  

I am a gamer and been a gamer since I was 5-year-old, but as I got older Videogames had 

a bad stigma and was rumored to make people unproductive. fast forward The Clock to 2013 people now have made a Income  

and have become even wealthy playing videogames via streaming. since then, the big Live stream boom started in the video game industry 

and many people sought to be pro gamers, and then shortly after that E-sports started to show up. Teams that operate like pro basketball or pro football teams  

there for creating a divide and crushing many dreams of gamers that wanted to go pro. so, I want to change that with VSCoin.  

VSCoin will be a Crypto Currency for the competitive Gamer. Creating a situation where a Gamers investment in VSCoin can turn him into the pro gamer he or she dreamed about  

and the best part is the gamer community and VScoin community will dictate the value of the coin. Later in the future and a app will be released that is VSCoin powered. 

in this app gamers will be able to create tournaments or challenge other gamers for VSCoin. a gamer will pay a small fee to set up a tournament, the tournament players will pay a small fee to enter.  

the winner is then issued an amount of VS coin that was put in from the pot of the tournament. the coin is designed to maintain an upward trend as how many coins a gamer or investor holds dictates  

the value of VS coin. creating a scenario were even the winner would not want to sell all of their VScoins when they win a prize. Gamers and Investors holds will increase the value of VSCoin.  

I just wanted you to have an idea of how this project will work and more VSCoin powered features will come later in the app. The VSCoin Target Release date Is September 10 2021. But there may be a prerelease  

thank you all for taking this journey with me and being a part of history as the first Crypto Coin created by and African American makes history.
